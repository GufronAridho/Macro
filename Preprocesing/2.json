        "text": "Okay, The first is Sophia\u2019s Thai kitchen. It has 4.3 stars on google. Snug, enduring, and intimate bar & eatery with a tropical vibe offering country-style Thai fare & live folk music. Really good price and service. However, the food leaves more to be desired. The second is Thai canteen. It\u2019s rated 4.0 stars on google. Casual, bold-hued restaurant doling out counter-serve Thai food & snacks, plus beer, wine & sake. Prices are reasonable but you don't get any service. They also have outdoor seating there, so it's a great dog friendly place."
